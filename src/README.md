# The Grimoire 📖️👀️

(つ•̀ᴥ•́)つ*:･ﾟ✧

> Crack open the grimoire and lore me up brother...

A book of spells and incantations to make sure the flow of packets isn't interrupted.

### mdBook

I'm leaning on `mdBook` for the forseeable future - if this project carries on at all. It seems to bring all the benefits of a static site like my other `Jekyll` sites -- but with benefits to keep this repo light and uncomplicated.

[Source Code/Docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) are here.

### todo:

Gotta Add:

-   Hardware Section(s).
-   SSH
-   GPG
-   Mozilla/Firefox
-   Certs/OpenSSL
-   Nginx
-   Need to shout my shame and just dump all my messy half-finished articles, links, and bookmarks here. `:(`
-   Combine `Copy/Pasta` & `Notes`.
-   Edgerouter/VyOS Configs in place.
