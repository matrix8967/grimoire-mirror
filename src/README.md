### mdBook

I'm leaning on `mdBook` for the forseeable future - if this project carries on at all. It seems to bring all the benefits of a static site like my other `Jekyll` sites -- but with benefits to keep this repo light and uncomplicated.

[Source Code/Docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) are here.
