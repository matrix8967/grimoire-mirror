# Windows

I'm an avid critic of Microsoft - specifically of it's flagship OS `Windows.`

In recent years - what used to be an annoyance has quickly become _malicious_.

After you pay ~$140 for _permission_ to use Microsoft's OS on _YOUR_ hardware - you're left with a default OS that's bloated, insecure, and laden with adware &spyware. Not just adware from Microsoft itself through products like `Onedrive` and `Edge` - but from _"trusted"_ 3rd party vendors like `Facebook` & `Popcap Games`...

Decoupling your PC from the invasive & prying eyes at Microsoft begins before your OS is even installed...

# Warning/Disclaimer:

If you're planning on using any of this on your Work or School PC -- I would advise against it. Many of these customizations are built to give you (the user) more control over your machine.

This is *often* at odds with your organization's `EULA/AUP`^1.

At best, this may could trigger your organizations Enterprise Endpoint Protection (Antivirus). At worst, this could result in liabilities or even termination due to misuse of your organization's equipment.

Many of these configs, scripts, and applications require `local admin` access to run due to the nature & gravity of the configurations being modified.
