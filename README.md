# grimoire.mainframe.computer

Mostly technical garbage and notes for now.

I never post to `text.mainframe.computer` because it takes 200 years for me to edit _anything._

This is more of a place to centralize quick quick-and-dirty project documentation and things I get tired of looking around for in my notes.

S/O [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) for doing one thing and doing it well.
